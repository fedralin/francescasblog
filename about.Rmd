description: |
  I am Francesca, a junior at GW majoring in International Affairs and minoring in Journalism and Sustainability. I'm interested in the intersections between sustainability, international affairs, and communications. I'm taking a data journalism course and learning how to code with R to better improve my data visualization and communication skills.
